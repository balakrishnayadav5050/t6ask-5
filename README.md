Key Findings
1. Survival Count by Gender
More males were aboard the ship, but females had a significantly higher survival rate.

Insight: Gender was a critical factor, with women being prioritized for survival.

2. Age Distribution
Majority of passengers were young adults (20-30 years).

A few outliers aged above 70 were present.

Insight: Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

3. Fare vs. Age
Survivors generally paid higher fares.

High-fare passengers were often younger or middle-aged.

Insight: Higher fare payments were strongly correlated with survival.

4. Survival by Passenger Class
1st-class passengers had the highest survival rates.

Very few 3rd-class passengers survived.

Insight: Class disparity played a major role in survival chances.

5. Embarked Port
Most passengers boarded at Southampton.

Cherbourg passengers had higher survival rates.

Insight: Embarkation port reflects socioeconomic status and survival likelihood.

6. Deck Distribution
Decks B, C, D, and E had the most passengers.

Many cabin entries were missing, yet trends were visible.

Insight: Cabin deck correlates indirectly with survival.

Data Patterns
Age Distribution: Right-skewed, with most passengers being younger.

Fare Outliers: Some passengers paid over $500.

Cabin Data: Heavily missing but indicative of class and survival.
